Looks like there's some excitement building up for the Onchain Pill PFP choice! It's a clever concept, tying the choice of profile picture (PFP) to the Onchain ecosystem and token bags. So, essentially, the more people who choose a PFP, the more tokens remain for the token bags, right? And these PFPs also act as presale lottery tickets, adding another layer of engagement. Sounds like a fun way to engage the community while also incentivizing participation!
